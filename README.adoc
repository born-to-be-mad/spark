== Hints

=== All access to restricted API

The `sun.nio.ch.DirectBuffer` class is part of the internal APIs
that are not exported by the `java.base` module to other modules by default starting form Java 9.

You can add JVM options to allow access to the restricted internal APIs.
* In Gradle via `applicationDefaultJvmArgs`
* In IntelliJ IDEA, you can do this by following these steps:
** Go to `Run > Edit Configuration`
** Select your run configuration.
In the VM options field, add the following options: `--add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED`
